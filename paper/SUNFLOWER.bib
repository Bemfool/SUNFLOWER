	abstract = {The deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is the state-of-the-art solution for large-scale visual recognition. Following basic principles such as increasing the depth and constructing highway connections, researchers have manually designed a lot of ﬁxed network structures and veriﬁed their effectiveness.},
