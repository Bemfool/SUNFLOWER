abstract = {In this article, we have reviewed various advanced broadband and pulsed measurement techniques which have been developed for sampler-based NVNAs. We have seen that the RF modulation capability of sampler based NVNAs was not limited by the IF bandwidth of its receiver. Two methods for pulsed-RF, pulsed-bias measurements were also presented. The method based on the concept of multiple recordings enables one to achieve pulsed-RF measurements with 0 dB desensitization (no dynamic range degradation) even for very low duty cycles. Real-time active load-pull techniques for the rapid design of microwave power amplifiers were also presented. Finally, it was demon strated that pulsed-RF real-time active-load-pull could also be performed for the rapid design of pulsed-RF PAs or the characterization of transistors with reduced memory effects. These various measurements with sampler-based NVNAs were made possible thanks to the use of advanced ADC triggering techniques.},

abstract = {According to Mike McKinley of Georgia Tech, it's "the holy grail of microwave instrumentation and measurements," it's "a new measurement science" according to Don DeGroot of Connected Community Networks and "an enabling path to taking nonlinear models to a higher level of fidelity and value" says Larry Dunleavy of Modelithics. I prefer to call it large-signal network analysis (LSNA). Today, LSNA is undoubtedly still in its infancy. A small community knows about the theoretical concepts, and a happy few have access to LSNA hardware. This community is growing rapidly, however, and I have no doubt that the people of this community will soon revolutionize the microwave measurement business as profoundly as S-parameter technology did in the 1980s. I hope with this article to inspire you to join this rapidly growing LSNA community that is improving microwave measurements and is on its way to building a multimillion dollar business.},

abstract = {We describe a new outphasing energy recovery amplifier (OPERA) which replaces the isolation resistor in the conventional matched combiner with a resistance-compressed rectifier for improved efficiency. The rectifier recovers the power normally wasted in the isolation resistor back to the power supply, while a resistance compression network (RCN) reduces the impedance variation of the rectifier as the output power varies. Because the combiner requires a fixed resistance at the isolation port to ensure matching and isolation between the two outphased power amplifiers (PAs), the RCN serves to maintain high linearity as well as high efficiency in the switching-mode PAs. For demonstration, a prototype OPERA system is designed and implemented with discrete components at an operating frequency of 48 MHz, delivering 20.8 W peak power with 82.9\% PAE. The measurement results show an efficiency improvement from 17.9\% to 42.0\% for a 50-kHz 16-QAM signal with a peak-to-average power ratio of 6.5 dB.},

abstract = {In this paper, a 1 GHz class E2 DC/DC converter, implementing a frequency-modulation (FM) control, is proposed for efficiently handling wideband wireless signal envelopes. Properly terminating the inverting and rectifying GaN HEMT devices, a nearly linear output voltage versus switching frequency profile is obtained, with 70\% efficiency at a voltage value 5.1 dB below the peak. Incorporating a Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) and a gate-driving amplifier, the large-signal bandwidth (BW) and slew rate have been estimated to be around 20 MHz and 720 V/µSeg, respectively. The FM converter is also shown to offer a good dynamic reproduction of 6.6 dB peak-to- average power ratio (PAPR) 2- and 4-carrier WCDMA envelope signals, with average efficiencies over 60\%. Employed as envelope modulator in a pure polar architecture, handling a 5 MHz hole-punched multisine signal, a 6.7 W output power has been obtained with a transmitter efficiency of 56\%.},

abstract = {In this paper, the design and performance of class E2 resonant topologies for dc/dc power conversion at UHFs are considered. Combining the use of RF gallium-nitride HEMT devices, both for the inverter and synchronous rectifier, with high-Q lumped-element terminating networks, peak efficiency values over 70\% may be obtained. Control strategies based on carrier bursting, switching frequency modulation, or outphasing are also shown to be feasible. Taking advantage of their improved dynamic response, when compared to low-frequency more traditional switched-mode converters, a class E3 polar transmitter for the EDGE standard has been designed and tested at 770 MHz, offering an average global efficiency over 46\% at 4.3 W of output power, through RF-based amplitude and phase constituting branches. Finally, the potential of such a high frequency of operation in terms of power density is explored, absorbing undesired coil parasitics for the original LC series interconnecting network in a 1-GHz design methodology.},

%==== 2 GHz Rectifiers

@article{Roberg2012,
abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical analysis of harmonically terminated high-efficiency power rectifiers and experimental validation on a class-C single Schottky-diode rectifier and a class- F-1 GaN transistor rectifier. The theory is based on a Fourier analysis of current and voltage waveforms, which arise across the rectifying element when different harmonic terminations are presented at its terminals. An analogy to harmonically terminated power amplifier (PA) theory is discussed. From the analysis, one can obtain an optimal value for the dc load given the RF circuit design. An upper limit on rectifier efficiency is derived for each case as a function of the device on-resistance. Measured results from fundamental frequency source-pull measurement of a Schottky diode rectifier with short-circuit terminations at the second and third harmonics are presented. A maximal device rectification efficiency of 72.8\% at 2.45 GHz matches the theoretical prediction. A 2.14-GHz GaN HEMT rectifier is designed based on a class-F-1 PA. The gate of the transistor is terminated in an optimal impedance for self-synchronous rectification. Measurements of conversion efficiency and output dc voltage for varying gate RF impedance, dc load, and gate bias are shown with varying input RF power at the drain. The rectifier demonstrates an efficiency of 85\% for a 10-W input RF power at the transistor drain with a dc voltage of 30 V across a 98-$\Omega$ resistor.},
